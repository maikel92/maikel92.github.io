> In a world full of blind people, one-eyed is king - Iliad

The capitalist world is based on specialization. If you need a specific service you’re not able to perform yourself, you buy it or you pay someone who knows how to do the job. This is why we marketers pay for so much tools. There’s just too much stuff you could be doing and too little time. So you pay a few bucks for a specific action that needs to be fixed. Thing is: those bills stack up quite a bit. Plus they’re made to look really smart, but most of them are pretty easy to perform yourself. So what if you would spend a few moments to learn a little bit of hacking your way through this stuff? You could become more knowledgeable yourself, learn a few tricks here and there and have much more control over the things you’ve created. 

This blog is aimed at giving you the tools to gain more control over your marketing assets. I hope it helps you to get the most out of your business. 

How do I intend to do this? 

## Teach a man to fish
I am a firm believer in thinking from first-principe (see this excellent blog series about this way of thinking, inspired by Elon Musk). This means that I don’t want to give you small growth hacks, but teach you the fundamentals from which you can build the rest. 

## Don’t spend before earning
Yes, it is possible to not spend anything before earning money. If you know the drills, you can copy-paste and perhaps tweak a few things of the masters who have gone before you.
